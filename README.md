## Description
This repository contains all the material used for TIW exam in 2021. You can find the task of the project [here](https://github.com/gblfrc/tiw-2021-gibellini-montemurro/blob/main/deliverables/specifica_progetto_aggiornata.pdf).

## Software requirements
The project was produced using **Eclipse (Java Enterprise Edition)**, which provides a built-in facet for web projects, but any IDE with the same functionality should work as fine. In addition, a server is needed to run the project and let it be usable by whichever browser; for this purpose, **Apache Tomcat 9.0** was used.

## Running
To run the project:
- Import it on your IDE cloning this repository+
- Add the project to the server
- Start the server
- Open a browser and head to the project's main page.

**Note**

If the project is running on localhost the project's path should be: 

` localhost:8080/tiw-2021-gibellini-montemurro/ `

Remember to replace 8080 with the actual number of the port assigned to the server
